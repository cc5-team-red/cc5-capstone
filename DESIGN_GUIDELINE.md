# Design Guideline

This document outlines how this app should be in terms of look and feel, to provide a consistent experience that facilitates and maximizes the disaster response experience.

## Core Design Values

All text and interfaces should be created so that it upholds the following core design values:
#### Functional
  - All interfaces and text should, above all, *express it's function*.
#### Simple
  - Use logos and visual cues instead of text wherever possible.
  - There should be absolutely no flair or attitude that does not provide additional value to the user in the disaster context.
  - Do not have any interfaces that cause confusion.
#### Accessible
  - the user should be able to intuitively navigate through the app with little to no education.
#### Safety
  - the user should be informed whenever a user is about to conduct an unsafe operation.
  - eg: begin sharing location
  - eg: go near a hazard / help marker

## Color Scheme
- with the core design values in consideration,  
we will use the ISO international standards for safety symbols ([ISO 3864](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3864))

Meaning |  Name | RGB Hex[3] | 
-- | -- | -- |
Warning | Signal Yellow | #F9A800 |  
Prohibition/Fire Equipment | Signal Red | #9B2423 |  
Mandatory | Signal Blue | #005387 |  
Safe Condition | Signal Green | #237F52 |  
Backgrounds and Symbol | Signal White  | #ECECE7 |

- Text Color: signal black #2B2B2C
- Font: 
- The map will displayed in explicitly greyscale, so that the markers will become visually easier to identify.
- Markers: Use [ISO 7010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_7010) markers wherever possible.

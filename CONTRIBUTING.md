# How to Contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Zenni](https://github.com/cc5-team-red/zenni/pull/new/develop) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). We can always use more test coverage.

Please prefix your commits with one of the following for clarity:
- `Feat:` New features
- `Refactor:` Code Refactoring
- `Fix:` Bug Fixes
- `Docs:` Documentation Changes
- `Style:` App Styling

Commits can be short, but please be descriptive.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
Team Zenni Developers
